"""Regression scenarios for the native Bloom host on the offscreen compositor.

Runs `oxyos-offscreen --launch` with a scenario's steps, with the host writing its report
(OXYOS_HOST_REPORT), then checks every step's EXPECTED result, not only that pixels changed:

- texts / absent: text the application shows (or must not) once the step settled, across its
  window and popups (each surface's latest presented frame);
- focus_input: the text input holding focus (null for none), from the latest frame;
- focus_surface: the application surface with the compositor's keyboard focus;
- react: the exact events delivered to React during the step, as "event@name" -> count, where
  name is the target's testID or the nearest ancestor's (`within`). Any delivered event the step
  does not list fails it, which catches duplicated and leaked events;
- delivered: compositor input routed to the application per surface (exact), plus `leaked`
  (what the session's shell takes is its own, never leaked),
  input routed to any other client;
- popups: how many popups of the application are shown after the step;
- shell: with the scenario's `shell` module run as the session's shell (ADR 0009), its surfaces
  ("surfaces": output rectangles, compared as a set; "top": the topmost) and the "work_area"
  they leave, exactly;
- output_pixels: as pixels, in output coordinates rather than the window's;
- window_shown: whether the application's window is on the screen (a minimized one is not);
- field: what the focused surface told the compositor of its text field (ADR 0008), each key
  given matching (text, anchor, cursor, purpose, hints, caret...), or null for none;
- im: with the scenario's `input_method`, what the session's input method was told of the field
  and the keys it received in the step (active, purpose, text, cursor, keys, given_back...);
- latency_ms: budget from injecting the input to the first changed frame;
- pixels: colours of the output once the step settled, "x,y" (window-local logical pixels at
  scale 1) -> "#rrggbb", each channel within `pixel_tolerance` (3 by default).
  (Pointer enter/leave, which follow every motion, are left out of `react`.)

A step's `expect_devices` replaces expectations of its `expect` when its input comes through the
virtual devices (`--uinput`), where a keyboard types one key at a time and a wheel scrolls one
notch at a time: what React and the client receive is then counted per key and per notch. A
scenario's `layout` (an XKB layout, `us` by default) is the one those expectations are written
for, and the devices type with it. A `commit` step is an input method's committed text, which
no keyboard types, so it is the same on both paths; so is a `transaction` step, an input
method's whole change (ADR 0008).

A scenario with `input_method` runs with an input method the session plays: `keyboard` steps type
through it (it gives the keys back), `compose_keys` steps have it compose them (Enter commits),
and `im_change` steps send a change of its own, for the field's latest state or (`stale`) the one
before.

A scenario's `final` expectations (texts / absent / focus_input) are checked on the last frames,
once every step has run; a scenario may have no steps at all.

Also reports render times per frame and the launch time. Exit status 0 only if every
expectation holds.
